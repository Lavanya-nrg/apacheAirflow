## Introduction

This repository serves as a collection of Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs) implemented using Apache Airflow, showcasing various features and best practices. Apache Airflow is an open-source platform for orchestrating complex data workflows. This README provides an overview of DAGs, different operators available in Airflow, and key features of the platform.

## Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs)

**Definition:**

  A DAG is a finite directed graph with no directed cycles.
  In the context of Apache Airflow, DAGs represent workflows or pipelines that define the sequence and dependencies of tasks to be executed.

**Purpose:**

  DAGs provide a visual representation of workflows, making it easier to understand and manage complex data pipelines.
  They enable parallel execution of tasks while respecting dependencies, improving overall efficiency.

## Operators in Apache Airflow

**Definition:**

  Operators define individual tasks within a DAG.
  Each operator performs a specific action, such as executing a command, running a Python function, or transferring data.

**Types of Operators:**

  **BashOperator**
  
  **PythonOperator**
  
  **DummyOperator**
  
  **Sensor**
  
  **File Transfer Operators**
  
  **Databases Operators**
  
  **Email Operators**
  
  **Custom Operators**

## Extensibility:

  Airflow provides a rich library of built-in operators covering various use cases.
  Users can also create custom operators to suit their specific requirements by subclassing the base operator classes.

## Apache Airflow

**Overview:**

  Apache Airflow is an open-source platform for orchestrating complex data workflows.
  It allows users to define, schedule, and monitor workflows as directed acyclic graphs (DAGs).
  Airflow provides a scalable and extensible framework for workflow automation and scheduling.

**Key Features:**

  **Dynamic DAGs**
  **Extensibility**
  **Rich UI**
  **Task Dependency Management**
  **Integration**
  **Scalability**

**Architecture:**

  Airflow consists of several components, including the Scheduler, Executor, Metadata Database, Web Server, and Worker Nodes.
  The Scheduler orchestrates the execution of tasks based on the defined DAG schedule.
  Executors manage task execution, and the Metadata Database stores workflow metadata and state information.
  Web Server provides a user interface for DAG management and monitoring.
  Worker Nodes execute individual tasks as directed by the Scheduler.

## Prerequisites

Before using the DAG examples in this repository, ensure you have Apache Airflow installed and configured on your system. You can refer to the official documentation for instructions on setting up Airflow locally or explore other deployment options provided in the installation guide.
Setup
